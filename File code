<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>the design, planning,
execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the
objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure,
leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand, and measuring
performance globally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Here is an even simpler
way to define supply chain management:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'><img width=32

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>This way of looking at
supply chain management helps show that logistics is its core but that SCM’s
scope is expanded to the larger supply and demand network of business partners.
As stated in the&nbsp;<i>Dictionary</i>&nbsp;definition, leveraging worldwide
logistics means that you take advantage of your and your suppliers’ and
customers’ logistical networks rather than reduplicating efforts. Similarly,
measuring performance globally means that your feedback loop is expanded in
scope from the earliest raw materials to the final handoff to the customer and
post-sale service. The idea is for the network as a whole to become more
competitive than any one company could be on its own. Rather than companies
competing, now it is whole supply chains competing. These global viewpoints
require that information on supply and demand and performance be shared among
key external partners to create net value for all participants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Given the enthusiastic
embrace supply chain management has received, the role of logistics might get
less attention. However, success in extended supply chain partner integration
and strategies such as postponement cannot succeed without mastery of the
fundamentals of perfect order fulfillment at low enough costs and high enough turnover
to enable competitive advantage. That said, logistics thrives only when it can
see and support the big picture of organizational and supply chain strategy.
What is added to supply chain management to support that big-picture
view?&nbsp;<i>Exhibit 1-12</i>&nbsp;revisits the history of logistics and adds
some branches showing what supply chain management contributes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>This view illustrates how
large a role logistics plays in supply chain management. Added functions
include strategic planning, externally integrated information systems, the
demand generation portions of demand management (marketing and sales
interfaces), and supplier relationship management (SRM) for the inbound side
and customer relationship management (CRM) for the outbound side. Strategic
planning and relationship management are the most important of these additions.
Supply chain management and thus logistics have risen to become key
contributors to an organization’s strategic plan. While information systems
have long existed for logistics functions, the difference is that, with SCM,
information systems need to integrate external partners. Interfaces with
marketing and sales include their representing the demand side in sales and
operations planning (S&amp;OP) to balance out the supply side (materials and
production planning).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>SRM and CRM are
methodologies for developing and maintaining successful alliances with external
partners. While not exclusively information systems, SRM and CRM have an
information systems component that gives each contact point the same view of a
supplier’s or customer’s history for consistent interactions. A key way that
working closely with suppliers and customers adds value is by helping recognize
and eliminate all duplicate or non-value-adding activities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>While SCM is broad in
scope and strategic and relationship-oriented in nature, logistics is focused
on managing the physical movement of goods, including all of the complexities
of import and export and the proper timing of movements. While some of its
aspects, like network planning or providing information on capacity
constraints, are strategic in nature, the bulk of the work is tactical and
operational.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>This difference in
perspective between SCM and logistics has created a shift in how inventory is viewed.
It was previously seen as the buffer between the links in the chain, i.e.,
large safety stocks to protect against variations in supply. The SCM revolution
has changed this paradigm to one that looks first to improve information flow
to more closely match supply with actual demand and then to increase the
stability and reliability of the sources of supply and transportation.
Inventory is only a last resort.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;
color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Forming a long chain of organizations all
working together as one, with robust information sharing and a high degree of
trust, is a very difficult proposition, so naturally some supply chains have
had more success while for others it remains an elusive goal. The concept of
stages of integration or maturity helps organizations to determine where they
are at and where they would like to get to. These stages have been called by
different names, so the following descriptions provide several names for each
stage:</span></p>

reputation of poor cost control.</span></span></p>

logistics may have increasing levels of maturity in its level of influence over
the organization’s or supply chain’s strategy development processes. From a
single organization’s strategy development perspective, this maturity level
continuum may range from being handed a fully formed organizational strategy
with clear directives on how to develop a complementary logistics strategy, to
being asked to provide input for consideration in the organizational and
logistics strategies, to being handed the overall strategy but being
responsible for developing a complementary logistics strategy, to being an
active team member in both organizational strategy and logistics strategy
development.</span></p>

to determine is which organization is driving the overall strategy. This is the
channel master (also called nucleus firm), and it is usually the partner with
the most power in the relationship and/or the organization with the most at
risk. Logistics strategy development may be reactive if some other partner is
the channel master or proactive if one’s own organization is the channel
master.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;
letter-spacing:.15pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Logistics is sometimes
measured as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) to highlight the
economic impact it has on the comparative advantage between countries.
Comparative advantage is an economic concept that can refer to a country’s
ability to produce a given good more efficiently than other countries can.
Lowering the cost of logistics provides or reinforces these competitive
advantages. As of 2017, Vietnam’s percentage had fallen to 18 (from 22.5 in
2012) and China had fallen to the 14 to 15 percent range (from 17.8 percent in
2012). As of 2018, India remained in the 13 to 15 percent range (13 percent in
2012).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Often the infrastructure
in a country becomes a limiting factor in how efficient a logistics operation
can become. Countries such as Vietnam are making large investments in
infrastructure to become more competitive in this area. Other options could be
to reduce regulations, as China has done (in addition to investing in
infrastructure), such as reducing tolls and commercial vehicle testing
requirements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Leaders in this area, such
as Germany, Japan, France, and the U.S., also work to make improvements but
sometimes get mixed results due to the difficulty in improving systems that are
already efficient. According to the 30th annual “State of Logistics Report” by
the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, published in 2019, United
States organizations had 2018 logistics costs totaling US$1.64 trillion. This
was an increase over the prior year of 11.4 percent; however, as a percentage
of U.S. GDP, it was only a 0.50 percent increase, to 8.0 percent of GDP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Part of the reason that
certain countries have low logistics costs relative to GDP is that
organizations in these countries have made continued reductions in aggregate
inventory levels based on systems such as lean and just in time as well as
better logistics information systems. In 1981, inventory in the U.S. was 24
percent of GDP; in 2018, it was just 14.8 percent. Other significant components
of logistics costs include the costs of fuel and the relative differential
between supply and demand for transportation. During the Great Recession of
2008, logistics costs spiked upward as fuel and financing costs increased, and
a reduction in demand for containerships created a scarcity in certain areas of
containers available for backhauls to the Asia-Pacific region.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Economic Impact of Utility</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Another way of looking at
the economic impact of logistics is to return to the concepts of time utility,
place utility, and so on.&nbsp;<i>Exhibit 1-13</i>&nbsp;shows how high fuel prices
can result in an unacceptable cost while lower fuel prices can provide the same
product at a cost that leaves room for a profit margin at a price the consumer
is willing to pay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:#7B0048;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Exhibit 1-13: Fixed and
Variable Transportation Costs Impact Place Utility</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'><img width=32

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>The exhibit explores the
concept of place utility in the form of&nbsp;<b>landed cost.</b>&nbsp;According
to the&nbsp;<i>APICS Dictionary,</i>&nbsp;16th edition, “this cost includes the
product cost plus the costs of logistics, such as warehousing, transportation,
and handling fees.” Creating place utility involves transporting goods to
places where they are in high demand and thus will command a higher price.
Getting a product to that point while still allowing for a net profit at a
competitive price is the goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Exhibit 1-13</span></i><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>&nbsp;shows
that logistics has both fixed and variable costs. Reducing either of these
costs can help keep the landed cost acceptable. The exhibit assumes that the
price of the product and the fixed logistics costs (i.e., overhead) will remain
the same between the scenarios but that fuel prices can increase or decrease
the variable cost, or cost per kilometer or mile, within a given range. (A
change in this rate changes the slope of the line in the exhibit.) The longer
the distance in a transportation journey, the greater the savings of any
reduction in variable costs. Conversely, higher variable costs are exacerbated
by longer distances. The exhibit shows that sourcing closer to the point of
demand is one way to reduce risks because it reduces the variability of logistics
costs related to distance. Of course, sourcing closer to the point of demand
could raise the price of the product or the fixed logistics costs, at which
point there may or may not be savings from moving closer. Finding ways to
reduce fixed logistics costs is one way that 3PLs and package services provide
added economic value. Larger organizations with more units to ship can spread
their fixed costs over a larger number of units.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Transportation cost is
also related to an organization’s effective market area. The law of squares (or
Lardner’s law) states that any reduction in transportation cost will be
directly proportional to the increase in the market area where the product can
be sold competitively. That is, if you reduce the transportation costs by half,
you double the radius that you can serve. The law of squares refers to the fact
that doubling the radius of a circle results in about four times the geographic
surface area. (The circle expands in all directions.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>From a time utility
perspective, a critical way to increase the economic value of logistics is to
increase inventory turnover. One way to do this is by reducing the number of
days that inventory remains in the pipeline. The order cycle time is directly
related to the amount of aggregate inventory that must be kept.&nbsp;<i>Exhibit
1-14</i>&nbsp;shows how this curve increases faster as order cycle times grow
very long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:#7B0048;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Exhibit 1-14: Units in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>A customer’s average
inventory is a function of the cycle time and the units sold during the cycle
time plus safety stock. If 100 units are sold per day in a 10-day cycle time,
then 1,000 units will be the amount of inventory the supplier will replenish at
each order. Divided by 2, this is 500 units in average (assuming no safety
stock). If the cycle time is reduced to 5 days, this would be 500 units per
order and an average inventory of 250 units. Reducing the order cycle time will
provide two types of inventory cost savings. First, there will be a one-time
cost savings because the average inventory level will drop and there will be
less investment in inventory. Second, there will be ongoing annual savings
because the inventory level used in inventory carrying cost calculations will
be lower. In one study cited in&nbsp;<i>Managing Supply Chains—A Logistics
Approach</i>&nbsp;by Coyle et al., it was estimated that taking certain
measures would reduce the number of days spent in and between warehouses and in
retail space from 104 days to 61 days, which would save US$30 billion per year
for the grocery industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Note that logistics costs
often vary significantly by industry.&nbsp;<i>Exhibit 1-15</i>&nbsp;shows
results for logistics as a percentage of sales for various industries. The McKinsey
&amp; Company article that referenced this information made the point that
while logistics consumes a significant portion of fast-moving consumer goods
(FMCG) and chemical industry budgets and thus is on their list of priorities
for strategic improvements, implementing continuous improvements to logistics
using techniques such as lean should be a priority even for industries such as
pharmaceuticals, because it can pay off in improvements to their reputation
with customers. Also, when organizations find ways to spend less on logistics
without harming customer service, they have more money to invest elsewhere,
such as in research and development, or are better able to remain
price-competitive and profitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>In many other areas, the
economic cost of logistics reflects the tradeoffs discussed elsewhere. For
example,&nbsp;<i>Exhibit 1-16</i>&nbsp;shows that when graphing logistics cost
against customer service, the curves for the cost of lost sales and the cost of
inventory have an inverse relationship. Too low levels of inventory (or too few
reorder points) have high levels of lost sales, while the opposite is true for
very high levels of inventory (or a large number of reorder points). The total
cost curve is simply the sum of the two other cost curves. In the exhibit, note
how the total cost curve has a wide area where costs remain relatively low over
an extended range: The lowest possible cost will be near the point where the
two curves intersect, but the important takeaway is that the organization needs
to keep its activities somewhere within this optimal cost range. A very similar
relationship can be observed when the transportation cost curve is substituted
for the inventory cost curve. This would be true any time an increase in
transportation cost is related to an increase in customer service (more
reliable or faster).</span></p>

     at 63 percent of total logistics costs (US$669 billion for motor carrier
     and US$369 billion for all other modes). Inventory carrying costs were 30
     percent, and the warehousing portion of this was about 9 percent of total
     logistics costs.</span></li>

logistics has to do with comparative advantage. A comparative advantage in one

plays out in an analysis of the spatial relationships between suppliers,
producers, and key markets. The cost of transportation generally increases with
distance, so the relative distances between transportation nodes can be broken
down to determine where the cost advantages and disadvantages exist.</span></p>

font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>In this example, the local
provider’s key competitor has half the production cost. This disadvantage to
the local producer is offset in a relative cost advantage provided by low
logistics costs, allowing the local producer to undercut the price of the product
in that market by €1 per unit. However, this local producer will not fare as
well in a different market area that is distant from their production source.
The producer with low labor costs will have an advantage in many of these
more-distant key markets. Furthermore, the low-labor-cost producer could take
other measures to reduce logistics costs. For example, establishing a warehouse
in the key market might allow the competitor to ship consolidated full
container loads rather than less-than-container loads to that market. Of
course, the warehouse would increase other costs that would need to be
considered.</span></p>

has accelerated the rate of change and the level of volatility that
organizations operate in. This rate of change is much faster in some industries
than in others. Global trade in 2012 doubled that of 2002. In addition to
needing to deal with the additional volume and complexity this represents,
another major impact is that organizations—and especially their logistical
networks—need to become adaptable and resilient or they will be replaced by others
who are. Walmart was touted for years as the pinnacle of supply chain success
and is still doing very well at managing their vast network, but U.S.–based

the supply perspective, China has become a global consumer of so many
commodities on such a large scale that whatever occurs in that market will
affect commodity markets worldwide. Commodity prices have in fact become
considerably more unstable in the last decade than they ever were in decades
past. Countries with low labor costs do not stay that way for long. Rising
economic success for a country generates a larger middle class, and wages increase.
The rankings of countries in terms of their cost advantages and disadvantages

the demand side, consumer expectations of a high level of customer service have
been increasing, and the ability to source globally using internet searches
gives consumers far more power. Global competition is also shortening product
life cycles. As substitute goods come on the market quickly, premium pricing
erodes faster and products enter maturity and decline faster. While
collaborative product development helps shorten the research and product launch
phases, the same is true for competitors’ products.</span></p>

transportation, local delivery, or other logistics services are provided

means of transport in other places. Ports still use manual stevedores in some

impact of globalization is seen in where organizations are locating facilities

setup was for organizations to import inexpensive raw materials and manufacture
primarily for a domestic market. Now organizations are exporting more finished
goods, and developing markets are producing subcomponents for final assembly
closer to each market. Japanese car manufacturers have plants in the U.S., and
U.S. auto manufacturers have plants in China. Many emerging market economies
are growing quickly and provide new markets, particularly Brazil, Russia,
India, and China (BRIC), but they also add new challenges in terms of setting

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>In
2014, John Larkin, managing director and head of transportation capital markets
for Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., stated that 9 percent of retail sales were
online at that time but that they were growing at 15 percent per year, or five
times the rate of brick-and-mortar retail, according to an article on
FleetOwner.com by Sean Kilcarr. However, as of 2017, U.S. e-commerce retail
sales were only between 9 and 10 percent, according to research by the American
Transportation Research Institute in a 2019 article on FleetOwner.com by Neil
Abt, so the predicted rate of growth has slowed.</span></p>

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>China
serves as an example of the growth of e-commerce. Forty-six million Chinese
people shopped online in 2007. The rapid penetration of smartphones, however,
has increased online shopping there by between 49 and 70 percent per year for
the past four years, to a total of 461 million online shoppers in 2015—a third
of the population. As of 2017, 533 million shoppers purchased goods online. Of
these online consumers, half are even buying some groceries online. This number
is staggering in comparison with the rest of the world, which has roughly 25
percent of consumers shopping for groceries online. China is now the largest
e-commerce market, having overtaken the U.S. in 2013. In that year, online
sales in China surpassed brick-and-mortar sales as a percentage of total sales
of consumer goods, and that gap continues to widen.</span></p>

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>The
continued acceleration of e-commerce has had a major impact on organizations
and on logistics in particular. If goods shipped to stores aren’t selling but
online demand is high, there is the logistical issue of how to get the goods
from the retail stores to the consumers. Many retailers have started treating
their stores as online fulfillment centers. However, this type of logistical
system is not necessarily as efficient as a dedicated small-order fulfillment
center.</span></p>

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>The
retail delivery pattern involves shipments of goods or components from multiple
suppliers, consolidation at distribution and cross-docking centers, and
shipment from there to the retailers. This pattern emphasizes intermodal
transportation and full truck or container loads for efficiency and economies
of scale. The direct-to-consumer delivery pattern involves the same first steps
of getting goods and consolidating them at distribution centers, but from there
it becomes a series of small package deliveries directly to consumers. In some
cases, the direct-to-consumer delivery pattern involves forwarding individual
packages directly from suppliers to customers with no intermediaries. According
to the Neil Abt FleetOwner.com article, the rate of registrations for
single-unit trucks (i.e., trucks for the “last mile” or local delivery)
increased 7.8 percent between 2007 and 2016, while all truck registrations in
general grew by only 4.4 percent. During this period, the number of last-mile
truck trips increased significantly, which reduced the overall average for trip
lengths since 2000 by 37 percent. Overall, last mile fulfillment centers
represented 73 percent of the industrial real estate market in 2017, which was
a 15 percent increase over 2016.</span></p>

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>The
magnitude of the shift in delivery patterns from large shipments to retailers
to individual shipments to consumers is immense for the logistics industry.
Third-party logistics providers who specialize in TL (truckload) and LTL (less-than-truckload)
delivery are under pressure from the reduction in demand for their services.
Mergers and acquisitions are already occurring among traditional 3PLs as they
seek to scale upward to be large enough to start offering services other than
just TL and LTL. If this trend continues, there will be far fewer logistics
providers in the market, and those that survive will need to be able to provide
their traditional functions plus functions that are currently provided by the
likes of UPS (United Parcel Service), FedEx, and the United States Postal
Service (USPS). For example, according to Larkin in the article quoted above,
Amazon.com has a strategy to develop a private fleet to provide same-day
deliveries in their top 40 markets, use local delivery services for the next 60
markets, and rely on UPS, FedEx, and USPS only for the remaining markets. Part
of its strategy to achieve same-day delivery is to open distribution centers in
these urban areas rather than locating them in the countryside, as is the case
with many retailers, including Walmart.</span></p>

<p style='scroll-behavior: auto !important;margin:1rem;color:var(--gray-font)'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Roboto;color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt'>Even
the direct-to-consumer delivery pattern has been shifting. While there has been
a movement toward next-day delivery, for consumers who are working during the
day, this has resulted in packages left outside doors or missed deliveries. One
innovative solution developed by Wehkamp, a large Dutch mail-order company, was
to ask, “When do you want your delivery?” to help make deliveries when
customers are actually home. They even developed same-day delivery, in part by
reducing their time from customer order to ready to ship to 30 minutes. Other
European services have started making deliveries to small village grocery
stores or gas stations for customer pickup.</span></p>
